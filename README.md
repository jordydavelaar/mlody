## Description

MLody is deep learning network that computes polarized synchrotron coefficients. This public GitHub contains an Jupyter Notebook providing the code that was used to train the Network as well as a C++ code that can be used to interface MLody with other codes. 

Our C++ code heavily leans on the keras2c++ library that ca be found [here](https://github.com/gosha20777/keras2cpp)

## Installation

Makefile to compile the C++ code is provided. 

## Usage

After compilation the code can be run via '' ./MLody ''. As a test case the code initilizes the Network, and computes a single prediction based on hard coded values for the relevant plasma variables. 

## Contributing
